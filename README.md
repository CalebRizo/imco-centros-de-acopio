# IMCO Centros de acopio

IMCO's idea to find the nearest gathering center to better help those in need and for better resources distribution.

## About

Taking in account the last year earthquake, and the more recent ones, with the aim to help thos whom need it, this projects propose a interactive map to solve the problems with the lack of efficience in the distribuitoin of the collected resources.

This is an intercative map where the refuges can find the nearest recolecting spot to them.
